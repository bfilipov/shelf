Development
===========

Clone the repository.  Then source utils/init-environment

     source utils/init-environment

This will install a virtualenv in `venv` and install all required dependencies.  It will also add the root of the repository to $PYTHONPATH
enabling you to run commands from there.

Then you can run main.py to test changes with

     ./bin/main.py


* [Tests](tests.md) - Figure out how to run the tests.
