v1.0 - Initial release.
v2.0 - Added bucket reference name and metadata initialization at the time of artifact creation.
v2.1 - Corrected bucket ref name to work with bucket update, removed unnecessary body of 201 response on artifact creation, and fixed link format to match specifications.
v2.2 - Fix for bulk update and bucket name/reference name where metadata was
not updated if the reference name was changed
v3.0 - Add the ability to do a search with no body (essentially a wildcard path search), added a script which prunes the search index of old reference or
bucket names, also minor bug fixes.
v4.0 - Added createdDate which will automatically be added to metadata when an
artifact is created
v5.0 - createdDate again but this time with a simpler implementation (that
doesn't account for actual create date of existing items).  This has to do
with a limitation in boto/s3.
v5.1 - Fix for a bug where we only ever returned 10 results because
elasticsearch paginates by default.  Added option to be able to configure
and default to a more reasonable number.
v6 - Improve metadata validation and error messages. Default immutable on
metadata properties if it is not there. Ignore additional properties on
metadata.
v6.1 - Sort blows up if metadata property that doesn't exist is sorted on.
This was fixed in this release. Now it is sorted as None. Which results in
results without the property that is being sorted on to be first in ASC sorts
and last in DESC sorts.
v6.2 - Fixed a bug with bulk update for the search layer where nothing was being
deleted because it was using the bucket name in the path instead of the
reference name (which is how it is stored).
v6.3 - Fixed a bug similar to v6.1 but this only effected version searches.
Version sorts required returning "0" when the property being sorted on
was not there.
v7.0 - In this release we got test coverage up 100%!! We changed
HEAD requests on artifacts to avoid downloading artifacts. We also
properly install pyproctor in the dev requirements file no longer using git.
v8.0 - Changes to make sure we don't log sensitive information and added
retries to elasticsearch if the connection times out.
v8.1 - logging.NullHandler doesn't exist in python 2.6.6 so we added our
own.
v8.2 - Found a case where if the yaml was invalid for the config it would
log sensitive data.  I now swallow that error as well.
v8.3 - Found one last case where it could log something sensitive in
setup_elastic.py.  Now using common functionality.
v8.4 - Fixed bug where if a permission was not specified at all (instead of as
an empty array) it would blow up with a 500 instead of just giving a
permission denied.
v9.0 - Adding a health check endpoint. Fixed a bug where we were the api would
reject a request to metadata if the value was a boolean. Also started the
rename from pyshelf -> shelf.
v9.1 - Redacting authorization header from the logs to allow log shipping
without exposing secrets. This does a fuzzy match to ensure even misspelled
header names that are close are redacted such as "auth" or "authentication".
v9.2 - Fixed issue #63 which caused searching on a directory to find artifacts
that had the same name as the directory. Also fixed the search api returning
a 500 error if the JSON was invalid. It now returns a 400 error.
